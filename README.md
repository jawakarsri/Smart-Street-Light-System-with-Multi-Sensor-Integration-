# Smart-Street-Light-System-with-Multi-Sensor-Integration-
The Smart Street Light System optimizes energy usage and safety by integrating sensors. Conventional lights often waste energy and overlook environmental factors. This project addresses these issues with sensors, ensuring lights operate efficiently and respond to changes in light levels and pedestrian activity.
